    "### 6. Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the results produced from Tables 1 and 3, I was surprised to see that the U.S. and a lot of other first world countries did not make it to the top. In addition, one result in particular raised a red flag: Table 3 shows that North Korea is the top country for producing the highest percentage of high quality articles. Shocked and confused by the results, I took a step back to understand what the analysis was trying to accomplish in the first place. Upon further reflection, I realized the results included biases that stemmed from the proportion calculations used for analysis and the source of the data. In Table 1, it’s clear that the countries ranked at the top are only there because of their significantly small populations. Proportion of articles per population in this case is not a good measure for analysis since they can be heavily weighted towards countries with smaller populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting to work with the data, I had expectations that the results would show the U.S. being at the top for most proportion of articles per population and proportion of high quality articles. My initial assumptions came from the fact that Wikipedia is mostly used in the U.S. and that the data for articles on Politicians by Country we were using for analysis were derived from only English Wikipedia articles. Because of this, it only made sense that there would be more total articles on politicians from the U.S. and more high quality rated articles because of the surplus of knowledge coming from U.S. history and politicians.\n",
    "\n",
    "After going through the processing and analysis, I realized that there are other factors contributing to bias. Beside the one mentioned above (obtaining data on only English Wikipedia articles), I also noticed that the ORES API data’s method in scoring articles is a poor indication on measure of the actual contents within the article. The ORES MediaWiki page mentions that the article quality model is based on “predictions on structural characteristics of the article… it doesn’t evaluate the quality of the writing or whether or not there’s a tone problem”. This seems like a major issue regarding inherent bias within the analysis. If the source data rankings are solely based on structure of articles, it negates the rankings shown in Tables 3 and 4. If we consider the fact that some articles may not have as many sources available to begin with and some articles may not have many sections included based on how the information is presented, these factors have nothing to do with the actual quality of the writing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this was a great learning experience for coding, querying APIs, and most importantly documenting and reflecting on the data and processes. This helped to support my understanding and practice of achieving human centered data science by increasing accountability and promoting reproducibility. For future reference, I would suggest any researchers looking to improve and correct the biases observed to look into obtaining more reliable data sources. Perhaps, the scope of analysis can be expanded to all Wikipedia articles or more focus can be allocated to defining and measure true quality of the content within the articles using NLP methods. "
